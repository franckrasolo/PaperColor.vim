Light and Dark color scheme for Vim terminal editor and gVim

More info/screenshots: https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme

Inspired by Google's Material Design

Improve code readability; great for presentation

Currently designed for these file types: C, C++, Java, Makefile, CMake, Lex/Flex & Yacc/Bison, Bash, VimL, Golang, JavaScript, JSON, HTML, XML, Python, Ruby, Markdown, DTrace, SystemTap, PlantUML, Haskell, Assembly (MIPS, GAS, NASM), SQL/MySQL, Octave/MATLAB, Fortran, R, PHP, Perl, LUA, Clojure, Dockerfile, NGINX, Yaml, Dosini, Mail, reStructuredText

Other languages can still display well as long as your Vim is set up to recognize the language syntax even though that may not be the optimal experience. So, if the language you are working on isn't listed here, feel free to make a design request.

Plugin support: vimdiff, netrw, NERDTree, tagbar, tabline, vim-airline, vim-indent-guides, vim-startify
